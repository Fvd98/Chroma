# Chroma

Game designed through the course of 10 weeks with a excellent team of 3 artists and 5 programmers (myself included) for the 2021 Ubisoft Game Lab Competition.

We won the *Best quality of the "3C" (camera, characters, controls)* first prize, and were nominated for 2 other category : *Best Art Direction and Production* and *Best Creativity and Integration of the Theme* 

This was my second experience in actual game developpement, I learned how to use networking features for Unreal engine 4 (C++) and had a lot of fun working on a rope that attaches 2 entities, that lets you plit appart and merge back wisps. I also worked on the whole progress system through "Crystals" that request specific colored wisps. I worked on a lot of little things here and there too (e.g. the animation state machine blueprint, some HUD logic, bug fixing, dynamic materials, other's system interactions, etc.).

I'm very proud of the result of our efforts!

I'll upload only the files that I either had major impact on or designed entirely for portfolio purposes.
